## Purpose of Study

The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of designs for interacting with serious augmented reality systems. Specifically, in this case it is to determine the best way to present a large number of documents to the user. Augmented reality offers the potential for surrounding the user with extensive amounts of information intelligibly by using three dimensions. This leads to a basic question as to the best way to organise information around the user in a way to allow them to understand and browse information effectively.

The scenario for this experiment is to display electronic mail in three dimensions to be viewed an augmented reality headset. From previous work it has been established that there are six alternatives which we would like to evaluate. The evaluation would identify which layout is the most efficient, where efficiency is defined in a variety of ways including time efficiency and error efficiency.

## Participation

Your participation in this experiment is voluntary and you may choose to stop at any time and remove yourself from the study. If you feel nauseous at any time while wearing the augmented reality headset or otherwise, inform the researcher immediately and remove the headset.

## Researcher Contact

Please contact the researcher by email at v012065@northumbria.ac.uk if you have any questions about the experiment or wish to withdraw from the study. You will only be contacted by the researcher by email (if provided) and in relation to the study or if you want additional details on the study or results.

## Experimental Procedure

Participants will attend a laboratory session. After giving informed consent the participant will be shown a phone camera passthrough augmented reality system. They will then be presented with information which has been laid out in six possible arrangements and asked to familiarise themselves with each. These arrangements were identified from a previous participative design study. The participants will then be given a task to identify a particular document in the cloud of documents surrounding them.

The experiment will be conducted in two phases.

In the first phase, we will use the duration to find a document as a measure of the degree of difficulty in using that particular layout style. Along with time to identify a document, ability to identify a document correctly will also be recorded as another measure. For each configuration the participant will be asked to give a perceived measure of effort using a questionnaire called a NASA TLX. The layouts will be presented in a randomised order. 

The second phase will repeat the first phase except with an augmented reality headset. This will be conducted in the same way with comparable results. On completion of the phase, the participant will remove the augmented reality system and then answer a number of experiential and demographic questions.
Once complete the participant will be debriefed.

## Collected Data

Each participant will be given a number upon beginning the experiment. This number will then be used for identification of data and associated documents (consent forms, questionnaires).  Participants will also be given this number in case they later want to leave the experiment. Participant’s real names and other personal information will not be part of any published data set and will instead be anonymised using the participant number.

Data collected will be used to produce a series of metrics in order to better understand and to establish any difference between different arrangements of documents in augmented reality 3D space and method to view them and to investigate how significant a difference exists (if any).

Data collected will be stored securely on an external hard drive or USB stick and will only be retained as long as required. This drive will only be accessible to the researcher(s) required to process the data and will be kept locked up when not in use. The data will be kept by the researcher/project consultants until the end of the project. They will then be disposed of in line with Northumbria University’s retention policy as data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998. Results may be published in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings and may be used as part of the researcher’s thesis.
